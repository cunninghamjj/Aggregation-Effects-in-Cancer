Supplemental Figure 1. Left Panel - Dilution As neighborhood size increases from N=1 to N=10, the dilution effect allows a lower level of tumor cell resistance as seen with the decreasing final evolved value of resistance strategy v from u=0.62 to u=0.26 (top). Increasing neighborhood size with a dilution effect also causes greater recovery of tumor population density post therapy from 56.7% with no aggregation effects to 89.8% with dilution (bottom) Therapy is administered at t=0. Right Panel- Group Detoxification The protection of the group detoxification also allows for a lower level of evolved resistance by each individual cell as the neighborhood size increases. The effect is even more drastic than the dilution effect as u decreases from 0.62 to 0.12 (top) with a similar tumor population recovery of 84.9% at N=10 (bottom).

Supplemental Figure 2. Left Panel – Danger in Numbers As neighborhood size increases from N=1 to N=10, each cell must greatly increase its evolved resistance strategies due to environmental factors produced by the presence of a large population, resulting in a much reduced carrying capacity (see Figure 1) as u increases to 1.05 at N=10. The tumor is also unable to recover from the therapy as tumor size increases as shown with a final population density of 23.6% when N=10. Right Panel – Group Sellout In the group sellout model the effects of increasing the neighborhood size are drastic. At N=5 the resistance strategy required already increased to u=0.89. A tumor in an N=10 situation is completely eradicated. 

Supplemental Figure 3. Left panel - Switchover When a combination of dilution effects and group sellout are present where when N=5 the dilution effect is dominating, resulting in less resistance required as well as a significant recovery from therapy. Interestingly, when N increases to 10, the detrimental group sellout effects overwhelm the beneficial dilution effects and we see the increase in required resistance strategy (top) and decrease is final tumor population after treatment (bottom). Middle panel – Best Case A combination of the dilution effect and many eyes effect creates the best case scenario for a tumor. With a final reduction in tumor size of only 4% with a remarkably low resistance of 0.08 at N=5 and only 2% reduction with a resistance strategy of 0.03 at N=10, the benefits of this combined aggregation effects are significant. Right panel – Worst Case On the other hand, a combination of danger in numbers and group sell out results in the worst case scenario for tumors. At N=5 the tumor population is decreased by 81% even though the cells have evolved a huge resistance strategy of 1.29. At N=10 the population is eradicated. 

Supplemental Figure 4. Left panel- Dilution With the dilution effects at N=x/10+1 the treatment outcomes are similar to the static neighborhood size of N = 10 except for an additional 13% decrease in population density observed in comparison to N = 10 during the initial stages of drug treatment (bottom). When N=x the neighborhood effects are greatly exagerated as x = [0 100]. There is only a 2% reduction in cell density at an ESS of u=0.11. Right panel – Group detoxification Group detoxification demonstrates similar changes as neighborhood size is a function of population density with a 15% decrease in cell density for N = 10 and N = x/10+1 and only a 6% decrease in cell density when N=x.

Supplemental Figure 5. Left panel – Danger in Numbers The danger in numbers models show that when N=x/10+1 the dynamics are very similar to the N = 5 (Figure 4). When the more drastic relationship is used, N = x, this results in an 84% decrease in tumor density with a final ESS at 1.15. Right panel – Group Sellout The group sellout aggregation effects are so strong when N = x that the population is immediately eradicated.

Supplemental Figure 6. Left panel - Switchover When N=x/10+1 the dilution effect is still more beneficial than the group sellout effects, similar to N=5. On the other hand, when N=x, the group sellout becomes so strong so quickly that the tumor is eliminated immediately. Middle panel – Best Case For the best case scenario, both when N=x/10+1 and N=x the aggregation effects are amplified. For N=x the required resistance strategy is an insignificant v=0.002 with a population decrease of less than 1%. Right panel – Worst Case When N is scaled to x/10+1 the tumor can still survive through the combination of danger in numbers and group sellout effects but when N = x the tumor is easily eradicated.
